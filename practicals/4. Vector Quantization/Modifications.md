# Critical Thinking Questions

After implementing Vector Quantization, consider the following:

1. How is Vector Quantization similar to K-Means? In what contexts would you prefer one over the other?

2. What happens if the input vectors are very high-dimensional (e.g., 100+ dimensions)? Does the algorithm still work well? Why or why not?

3. How would you measure the quality of a codebook? What metric could tell you how much information is lost during quantization?

4. Suppose two different initial codebooks lead to two different final codebooks. Which one is “better”? How would you decide?

5. In image compression using VQ, what visual artifacts might appear if the codebook is too small?

6. Can you use the Elbow Method (from K-Means) to choose the best codebook size for a given signal? What would you plot?
