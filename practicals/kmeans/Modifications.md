# Critical Thinking Questions

After implementing the basic K-Means algorithm, consider the following:

1. The algorithm stops when centroids no longer move. Is this always a reliable indicator of a good clustering result? Why or why not?

2. What happens if the initial centroids are chosen poorly? Can the final clusters be significantly different? How might you reduce this sensitivity?

3. In real-world data, the number of clusters **k** is often unknown. How could you determine a reasonable value for **k**  just by examining the data or the behavior of the algorithm?
