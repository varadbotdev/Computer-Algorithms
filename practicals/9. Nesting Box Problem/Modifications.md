# Critical Thinking Task

1. How the algorithm identifies the best path if multiple paths are possible?

2. In the visualization, only the **longest path** is highlighted. Can you modify the code to show **all possible nesting chains** of maximum length?

3. What is the **time complexity** of this DP solution? How would it scale with 1000 boxes?

4. Try real-world data: define boxes based on common item sizes (e.g., books, shipping boxes). Does the algorithm produce a realistic nesting sequence?
