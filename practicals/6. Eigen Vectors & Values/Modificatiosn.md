# Critical Thinking Task

After understanding how eigenvalues and eigenvectors are computed, investigate their real-world applications.  

Explore and summarize **at least three distinct applications** of eigenvalues/eigenvectors in fields such as:  
- Computer vision (e.g., Principal Component Analysis)  
- Network analysis (e.g., Google’s PageRank algorithm)  
- Structural engineering (e.g., vibration modes of buildings)  
- Quantum mechanics  
- Machine learning  
- Graph theory  

For each application, briefly explain:  
1. What the matrix represents  
2. What the dominant eigenvector tells us  
3. Why this insight is useful
