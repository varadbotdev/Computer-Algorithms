# Computer Algorithms Lab Manual  
**Course Instructor**: Prof. D. B. Kulkarni  
**Course**: Computer Algorithms  

This repository contains interactive, self-contained lab practicals for the *Computer Algorithms* course. Each practical includes theory, a minimal working implementation, and critical thinking questions to deepen understanding.


##  How to Use This Repo

1. **Browse** any practical by clicking the links below.  
2. Read the **theory** and **algorithm** in `README.md`.  
3. Explore the **code** in the `code/` subdirectory.  
4. Run the program locally and (where applicable) use tools like `gprof` or SageMath for analysis.  
5. Reflect on the questions in `modifications.md` to go beyond the basics.
